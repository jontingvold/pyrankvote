    Preferential block voting (PBV) is a multiple candidate election method, that elected the candidate that can
    draw majority support (more than 50%). Minority groups therefore lose their representation.

    If only one candidate can be elected, this method is the same as Instant runoff voting.

    Voters rank candidates and are granted as many votes as there are people that should be elected. The candidate with
    fewest votes are removed and this voters votes are transfered according to the 2nd preference (or 3rd etc.).

    The method is the same as *exaustive ballout*, where repetative voting rounds where everyone has just one vote (no ranking) and
    where the worst candidate is removed, until there are as many candidates left as positions that should be filled.
    This is the prefered method in Robers rules of order. The only between difference between IRV/PBV and exhaustive ballout,
    is that in exhaustive ballout voters can adjust votes according to partial results.
